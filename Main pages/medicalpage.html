<!--Description-->
<p>Healthcare facilities in the United States are largely privately owned. Health insurance in the USA is primarily obtained through employers, independently through private purchase, or through government-based programs. Some low-cost and cost-free health care services exist through non-profit organizations, charities, and publicly funded programs.</p>
<p>However, international visitors should always carry insurance when they visit the United States. The cost of treating a serious emergency can be catastrophically high. The cost of getting medical services in the US is one of the highest worldwide, which makes sense to be insured when visiting the country.</p>
<p>The Johns Hopkins Hospital has numerous initiatives that support the Hospitalâ€™s efforts to meet the needs of the community. There are over 300 programs and initiatives carried out or supported by administrative, clinical, and operational departments at The Johns Hopkins Hospital.</p>
